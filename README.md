# crk

This is a simple cork board app with sharable post-it notes and colored pins.

This was developed quickly for fun and to show off Backbone.js at the May 2011 meeting of TulsaWebDevs.

See http://mpov.timmorgan.org/backbonejs-talk-at-tulsawebdevs-may-meeting

## Installation

You'll need Node.js and the following `npm` modules:

* npm install express
* npm install jade
* npm install mongoose

You'll also need to have MongoDB running.

## Running

To run in development mode:

    node d.js app.js

Modifying a file should restart the app automatically.

## Testing

I have only tested this on Chrome 11. If you find issues with other browsers, let me know.
